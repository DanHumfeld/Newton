The first co-trained PINN problems: a block and a rocket block

I am still learning how to present the problem here in a readable manner.

### The Problem
A block of mass 1kg is at rest on a horizontal, frictionless surface, with no force applied to it. At some time weâ€™ll call t = 0, a force begins being applied to the block. Determine the force as a function of time that will cause the block to be at specific locations at specific times, under the constraint that the jerk (d<sup>3</sup>x/dt<sup>3</sup> = dF/dt /mass) may not be greater than 40m/s<sup>3</sup>.
